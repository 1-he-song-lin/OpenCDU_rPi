This is the Client code for a Raspberry pi 3. I've got it connected to an old FDS version 1 CDU & Sony PsOne Screen.

It was developed using QT and a cross platform development environment. I will try to provide more details soon (Once I've remembered what I did 2 years ago when I first wrote it!)

The files PMDG_NHX_SDK.h along with their license and ReadMe file is taken from the PMDG 737 installation directory and is reproduced here with the kind permission of PMDG Simulations LLC

The first thing to do is to load linux onto your rPi, configure the screen and get it talking across the network. Then create a startup script to fire-up cducomm.
